                    country.
                    Throughout the years, most countries have been making a major progress in <b>expanding</b> the
                    <b>accessibility</b>
                    to education for individuals at any level.<br><br>Figure 1 is a donut chart that showcases how
                    educated each region is
                    based on the number of learning outcomes that the region provides. There is an association with
                    the number of learning outcome
                    and the economic status of each region.</p>

                    academy. Countries that
                    are more richer tend to have better education outcomes than those countries that are less developed.

                    accessibility to provide expected learning outcomes therefore an overall increase in numbers of
                    learning outcomes in 2017
